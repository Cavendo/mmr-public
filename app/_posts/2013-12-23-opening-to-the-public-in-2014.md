We’ve been hard at work at MyMediaRoom making lots of changes and getting ready for our big reveal: **starting in 2014 MyMediaRoom will be available to the public**.

Started in 2007, MyMediaRoom has always had the simple goal of making media content distribution as simple as possible. We have worked with membership organizations, non-profits, and small businesses to make on-line media distribution available in just one click.

If you have an existing account with us you now have access to our new Dashboard. From here you can easily manage and distribute all of your content. Stay tuned as we roll out more features and open public registration in the coming weeks.

Let us know what you think. We’ve built MyMediaRoom based on your feedback and will continue to do so. If you have any questions you can always reach out to us at [support@mymediaroom.com](mailto:support@mymediaroom.com).
